\textit{There is a particularly common and---at least until recently	---widely believed seafarers’ tale which may be heard everywhere from the most noisome seafront dives to the elegant drawing rooms of the ship-owning aristocracy. This is ‘supersymmetry’. It is a seductive story. It offers many things to the excitable traveller,	 and	 one of the things it offers is Dark Matter. }

\textit{Let us hope that new experiments $\cdots$ will soon reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. Perhaps it will look something like the possibilities discussed, but let us hope that it will take us beyond the beyonds imagined by theorists.
