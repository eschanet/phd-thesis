\chapter{Reinterpretation in the pMSSM}\label{ch:pmssm}

\graphicspath{{chapter-pmssm/Figs/Vector/}{chapter-pmssm/Figs/}}

After having discussed methods and approaches to reinterpret ATLAS searches for \gls{susy}, this chapter exploits the analysis approximations previously introduced, and presents a reinterpretation of the \onelepton search in the \gls{pmssm}.

\section{Motivation}

In today's searches for \gls{susy}, it is common to use simplified models as a way of avoiding the necessity of having to deal with high-dimensional parameter spaces that are extremely challenging to sample and compare to data.
As has been discussed in~\cref{sec:simplified_models,sec:onelepton_discussion}, simplified models are however by no means complete \gls{susy} models, but only serve as proxies for more complex and realistic \gls{susy} scenarios. As such, simplified model limits cannot trivially be translated into limits on model parameters of a more complete \gls{susy} model, and large-scale reinterpretations are necessary to understand the constraints current \gls{susy} searches set on realistic \gls{susy} scenarios. 

One class of more complete models, focussing on phenomenologically viable models, is the \gls{pmssm}, introduced in~\cref{sec:theory_pmssm}.
With its 19 parameters it offers much more complex \gls{susy} scenarios, while still being of somewhat manageable dimensionality.
Still, large-scale reinterpretations in the \gls{pmssm} are computationally challenging and require a set of approximations as those introduced in~\cref{ch:preservation,ch:simplify}.
In the following, the \textit{simplified analysis} constructed using the smeared truth-level analysis and the simplified likelihood will be used as the sole method to evaluate a set of \gls{pmssm} models.

Although the following sections will be restricted to a reinterpretation of the \onelepton search, efforts are ongoing within the ATLAS collaboration to perform large-scale reinterpretations using a majority of the Run~2 ATLAS searches for \gls{susy}, most likely resulting in one of the most comprehensive sets of ATLAS constraints on \gls{susy} yet.


%Large-scale reinterpretations in the \gls{pmssm} using a collection of relevant ATLAS \gls{susy} searches not only allow to assess the sensitivity of the ATLAS \gls{susy} search program towards more realistic \gls{susy} scenarios, but can also potentially reveal interesting regions of the parameter space not yet covered by the current search programme. Moreover, such reinterpretations allow to demonstrate the sensitivity of simplified model searches beyond the simplified models they are originally interpreted in, thereby justifying the use of simplified models as proxies for more complete \gls{susy} scenarios. In addition, reinterpretations in the \gls{pmssm} can be used to connect the ATLAS \gls{susy} searches with dark matter constraints from non-collider experiments, as well as Higgs and flavour measurements. \unsure{might want to tweak this last sentence} 

%reinterpretations are not only of interest for the wider \gls{hep} community, but also for the experimental collaborations themselves. Within ATLAS, such efforts can serve as powerful tools for shaping the future of the search program. Reinterpretations of ATLAS \gls{susy} searches in more complete \gls{susy} models like the \gls{pmssm} not only allow to state a combined sensitivity of ATLAS to more realistic \gls{susy} models, but also enable the collaboration to identify potential blind spots and parameter regions still uncovered by existing analyses. Such reinterpretations have been performed for the Run~1 dataset~\cite{pMSSM-scan-run1:2015baa,Aaboud:2016wna}. Similar efforts, aiming to reinterpret the current ATLAS searches for \gls{susy} in the \gls{pmssm} using the full Run~2 dataset, are currently ongoing. 

\section{Model sampling and processing}\label{sec:pmssm_sampling}


\subsection{Sampling}

All signal models considered in the following are sampled from the \gls{pmssm} using the parameter ranges shown in~\cref{fig:pmssm_scan_ranges}. Flat probability distributions are used to draw random values within the given ranges for each parameter and each unique set of \gls{pmssm} parameters generated that way is referred to as an independent \gls{pmssm} model.

As this work discusses a search for electroweakinos, the models drawn from the \gls{pmssm} are sampled with a special focus on the electroweak sector.
This is achieved by setting the mass parameters of the first and second generation squarks to values much higher than those accessible at \gls{lhc} energies, effectively decoupling them. Likewise, sleptons are also effectively decoupled because the \onelepton search is not expected to be sensitive to slepton pair production or scenarios with sleptons in the decay chains. 
For naturalness arguments, third generation squarks and the gluino are not strictly decoupled, but set to sufficiently high values such as not to affect the electroweak sector too much. 
The lower and upper bounds on the 12 scanned parameters are chosen such as to yield a high density of models with electroweakino masses accessible at \gls{lhc} energies, while allowing the scan to be as general as possible. 

Once a value for each of the 19 \gls{pmssm} parameters has been chosen, a number of publicly available software packages are executed in order to compute the properties of each model.
In a first step, \textsc{SPheno}~v4.0.5~\cite{spheno_1:2003um,spheno_2:2011nf} is used to calculate the spectrum of the sparticles, which, in turn, serves as input for determining the masses and branching fractions of the Higgs sector using \textsc{FeynHiggs} v2.15.0~\cite{FeynHiggs:1998yj,FeynHiggs_1:2018qog,FeynHiggs_2:2013ria}.
An additional \gls{susy} spectrum calculation is performed in parallel with \textsc{SoftSusy} v4.1.8~\cite{softsusy:2001kg}.
Although the spectra obtained from \textsc{SoftSusy} will not be directly used in the following, the program is still required to complete successfully in order to reduce the number of \gls{pmssm} models with pathological properties.
After the complete model spectrum has been calculated, the dark matter relic abundance of each model is determined with \textsc{micrOMEGAs}~v5.0.8~\cite{micromegas_1:2006is,micromegas_2:2010pz}.
%Finally, flavour physics and precision electroweak observables like $\upDelta\rho$, $\upDelta(g-2)_\mu$, $\mathrm{BR}(b\rightarrow s\gamma)$ and $\mathrm{BR}(B_s\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-)$ are determined using  \textsc{SuperIso}~v4.0~\cite{superiso:2008tp}.

%\textsc{GM2Calc}~v1.7.1~\cite{gm2:2015rva} and

\subsection{Selection and processing}

In order to avoid models with pathological properties, all spectrum generators and additional programs are required to complete execution without error. The cross sections for surviving models are computed at \gls{nlo} using \textsc{Prospino}~v2.1~\cite{prospino:314229, prospino_2:1999xh}. Models with inclusive cross sections for all electroweakino production processes below $\SI{0.07}{\femto\barn}$ are discarded as they would result in less than 10 expected signal events with an integrated luminosity of \onethirtynineifb, which is not sufficient to be sensitive to with current electroweak \gls{susy} searches. 
All models are further required to produce a lightest Higgs boson mass compatible within a $\pm\SI{5}{\GeV}$ range with the experimentally measured \gls{sm} Higgs boson mass\footnote{The mass range is based on a conservative estimate of the theoretical uncertainties arising from the \textsc{FeynHiggs} calculation.}. Models where the $\lsp$ is not the \gls{lsp} are also rejected.
%For the sake of experimental sensitivity, models are also required to have a lightest chargino with mass below $\SI{1.2}{\TeV}$ and produce a neutralino \gls{lsp}.
%Models with long-lived or even stable (on the time scale needed for traversing the ATLAS detector) sparticles\footnote{Not considering the \gls{lsp}.} are discarded as \gls{susy} searches targeting prompt electroweakino decays (like the \onelepton search), are not expected to be sensitive to these models. 

%As only $R$-parity conserving models are considered, the \gls{lsp} is stable and thus has a non-vanishing cosmological abundance. The resulting \gls{lsp} abundance is calculated but no upper limit is required in order to allow   required to be below the experimentally observed value of the cold dark matter relic density of $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.12$, thus not making a statement about whether or not the \gls{lsp} is the only \gls{dm} particle. 
No constraints on the computed cosmological \gls{lsp} abundance are applied at this stage in order to give a more general view after the models are evaluated using the \onelepton search. For the same reason, experimental constraints like the lower limit on the chargino mass from \gls{lep} are also not applied at this stage. 

Of the \num[group-separator={,}]{10000} unique models sampled from the \gls{pmssm} using the above prescription, \num[group-separator={,}]{5152} models survive the constraints and requirements discussed in this section and are analysed using the simplified \onelepton search. The majority of the models failing this selection step were rejected due to the cross section constraint.

\subsection{Event generation}

Event generation is performed using the software centrally provided by the ATLAS production system. The initial pair of sparticles with up to one additional parton in the matrix element are generated using the \textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} v2.6.1.~\cite{MGaMCNLO:2014hca,Frederix:2012ps} generator. Next, \textsc{Pythia8.230}~\cite{Pythia8:2007gs}  with the \textsc{A14}~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} tune is used for the hadronisation and parton showering, together with the NNPDF 2.3 LO~\cite{Ball:2012cx} \gls{PDF} set. The number of events $N$ generated for each model is determined by
\begin{equation}
	N = \sigma \times \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{eff},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{eff} = \SI{700}{\per\femto\barn}$ is an effective integrated luminosity and $\sigma$ is the total production cross section of the model. The number of events generated for each model is capped at a minimum number of $10^4$ and a maximum number of $10^6$ truth-level events.

\subsection{Truth-level analysis}

All models passing event generation are evaluated using the simplified analysis comprised of truth-level inputs, four-vector smearing and the simplified likelihood. This is the only evaluation done for the models considered herein. A full scan over the \gls{pmssm} including multiple ATLAS searches would additionally include a processing step reverting back to the full analysis available through \textsc{Recast} for model points where (non-)exclusion is uncertain based on the simplified analysis only.

\section{Phenomenology of the LSP}\label{sec:lsp_pheno}

The composition of the $\lsp$ in each \gls{pmssm} model sampled is shown in projections onto the \mbox{$m(\charg)$--$m(\lsp)$} and \mbox{$m(\neutr)$--$m(\lsp)$} planes in~\cref{fig:lsp_types,fig:lsp_types_N2}, respectively. The $\lsp$ is considered to be bino-like ($\tilde{B}$-like), wino-like ($\tilde{W}$-like) or higgsino-like ($\tilde{H}$-like) if the corresponding fraction from the neutralino mass mixing matrix is at least 80\%. If more than one component has a fraction of more than 20\%, then the $\lsp$ is considered to be of mixed nature. For example, a $\lsp$ with more than 20\% bino-, wino- and higgsino-components is referred to as $\tilde{B}\tilde{W}\tilde{H}$-like. The nature of the \gls{lsp} as a function of the bino, wino and higgsino mass parameters ($M_1$, $M_2$ and $\mu$) is shown as a reference in \cref{fig:lsp_phenomenology_parameters}.

Details on how the \gls{lsp} type is defined are given in the text.}
	\label{fig:lsp_phenomenology}
\end{figure}

In the bulk of the $m(\charg)$--$m(\lsp)$ plane, \ie the parameter space targeted by the \onelepton search using the simplified model, a large majority of the models produce a bino-like \gls{lsp} with nearly mass-degenerate $\charg$ and $\neutr$. These models correspond to cases where $M_1 \ll \mu$ and $M_1 < M_2$ and thus produce electroweakino spectra similar to the canonical simplified model considered in the \onelepton search. Some sensitivity can therefore be expected towards these models in the context of the \onelepton search, provided that the decays $\charg \rightarrow W^\pm \lsp$ and $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$ have sufficiently large branching fractions and produce on-shell bosons.

Towards the diagonal of the $m(\charg)$--$m(\lsp)$ plane, \ie for models with nearly mass-degenerate $\charg$ and $\lsp$, the nature of the \gls{lsp} shows a larger variation.
In a large set of models where $M_2$ is not too large and much smaller than $M_1$ and $\mu$, the \gls{lsp} has a significant wino component and is nearly mass-degenerate with the $\charg$, while the $\neutr$ and other electroweakinos can be more massive.
In models where the \gls{lsp} has a large higgsino component, \ie $\mu$ is much smaller than $M_1$ and $M_2$, the three electroweakinos $\charg$, $\neutr$ and $\lsp$ are nearly mass-degenerate and, if promptly decaying, result in very soft decay products, making these models inherently difficult to target.

\section[Impact of the $1\ell$ search on the pMSSM]{Impact of the $\makemebold{1\ell}$ search on the pMSSM}

In the following sections, the impact of the \onelepton search on the \gls{pmssm} is discussed using one-dimensional and two-dimensional projections and distributions.
A model is considered to be excluded if the observed CL$_s$ value obtained with the simplified likelihood using the smeared truth-level inputs and the simplified likelihood is below 0.05.
Of the 5152 models evaluated, the \onelepton search excludes a total of 98, or about 1.9\%, of the models.

For the one-dimensional distributions shown in the following, the total number of models is compared against the number of models excluded by the \onelepton search.
An additional pad indicates the ratio between models excluded and total models sampled in each bin of the distribution.
In the two-dimensional projections, the numbers in the bins indicate the number of \gls{pmssm} models sampled in each bin.
In these projections, the bin-wise fraction of models excluded with the \onelepton search is colour-encoded.
Bins in which all models are excluded are coloured in black, while bins without any excluded models are left white.
Where applicable, the exclusion contour obtained by the \onelepton search in the simplified model scenario is overlaid.

\Cref{fig:impact_electroweakinos_2D,fig:impact_electroweakinos_1D} show the bin-by-bin fractions of models excluded by the \onelepton search as two- and one-dimensional distributions, respectively. From the $\charg$--$\lsp$ plane in \cref{fig:mchi1p_mlsp_contour}, it can be observed that the \onelepton search is most sensitive to \gls{pmssm} models in electroweakino mass ranges similar to those excluded in the context of the simplified model. Most of the models excluded have $\charg$/$\neutr$ masses ranging from roughly $\SI{200}{\GeV}$ to about $\SI{700}{\GeV}$, and $\lsp$ masses ranging masses from $\SI{0}{\GeV}$ to about $\SI{300}{\GeV}$. The proportion of excluded models peaks at \mbox{$m(\charg$/$\neutr) \approx \SI{450}{\GeV}$} and light \glspl{lsp} with $\lsp < \SI{150}{\GeV}$, as visible in~\cref{fig:impact_electroweakinos_1D}.

\end{figure}

The models excluded by the \onelepton search can be classified in two broad categories: models situated within the parameter range enclosed by the simplified model exclusion contour, and models with nearly mass-degenerate $\charg$ and $\neutr$.
As discussed in \cref{sec:lsp_pheno}, most models within the simplified model exclusion contour produce a bino-like \gls{lsp} and result in nearly mass-degenerate\footnote{\Cref{fig:impact_electroweakinos_2D_bino_lsp} illustrates this behaviour further.} $\charg$ and $\neutr$.
Expectedly, the \onelepton search shows sensitivity to $\charg\neutr$ production in models with wino-like electroweakinos and a bino-like $\lsp$, resulting in spectra close to that of the canonical simplified model originally considered in the search.
The mass spectrum of such a model, excluded by the \onelepton search, is shown in \cref{fig:slha_1}.

The second category of models excluded comprises cases where the \gls{lsp} is wino-like and nearly mass-degenerate with the chargino. These models correspond to the diagonal of the $m(\charg)$--$m(\lsp)$ plane in~\cref{fig:mchi1p_mlsp_contour}. As the mass difference between the \gls{lsp} and the chargino is typically of the order of only a few $\SI{100}{\MeV}$, the chargino can become long-lived, and primarily decays to a \gls{lsp} and an off-shell \textit{W} boson that, in turn, decays into soft objects not reconstructed in the detector.
If the chargino is produced with large momentum, it can live long enough to traverse multiple layers of the ATLAS pixel detector before decaying, leading to a disappearing track signature. Searches targeting prompt electroweakino decays are not expected to be sensitive to these models, and instead dedicated disappearing track searches are developed within the ATLAS Collaboration (cf. \reference\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-015}). 
Even though no sensitivity to these models is expected from the \onelepton search, a small set of models with a wino-like \gls{lsp} can still be excluded. In these scenarios the next-to-lightest chargino $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2$ is comparably light, such that the \onelepton search is sensitive to $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2\neutr$ production with cross sections of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{\femto\barn})$.
If the next-to-lightest chargino decays directly into the \gls{lsp} via $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2 \rightarrow W^\pm \lsp$, enough events with an isolated electron or muon can occur, allowing to exclude the model\footnote{Provided that the branching fraction of the $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$ decay is also large enough, such that a final state with a lepton, $\etmiss$ and two \textit{b}-jets from a Higgs decay can be realised in a sufficient number of events.}. A representative mass spectrum of such a model, excluded by the \onelepton search, is shown in \cref{fig:slha_2}.

No sensitivity is observed for \gls{pmssm} models with higgsino-like electroweakinos, \ie compressed mass spectra\footnote{The mass spectrum of a \gls{pmssm} model with higgsino-like \gls{lsp} is shown in~\cref{fig:higgsino_spectrum}, highlighting that all three relevant electroweakinos ($\charg$, $\neutr$ and $\lsp$) are nearly mass-degenerate.}. This is expected, as the electroweakino decays in such scenarios typically produce off-shell \textit{W}, \textit{Z} and \textit{h} bosons, resulting in very soft final state objects that the \onelepton search is not optimised for. Dedicated searches (as for example \reference\cite{SUSY-2018-16}) are being performed by the ATLAS Collaboration to target such compressed scenarios. Work is ongoing to include these searches in the large-scale scans of the \gls{pmssm} that the efforts discussed herein are embedded in.

Only models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} are shown in both figures. In fig.~\subref{fig:fig_scatter_mchi10_BFHiggs_bino_withXsecCut}, models are also required to satisfy $\sigma(\charg\neutr)>\SI{1}{\femto\barn}$.}

\end{figure}

In general, the sensitivity of the \onelepton search to \gls{pmssm} models is significantly reduced, compared to the simplified model scenario, even in the electroweakino mass regions covered by the simplified model contour. The loss in sensitivity can be attributed to the fact that the simplified model assumes branching fractions of 100\% of the $\charg \rightarrow W^\pm \lsp$ and $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$ decays (with on-shell \textit{W} and \textit{h} bosons).
The decay of the chargino through an on-shell $W$ boson is, in general, a good assumption in $R$-parity conserving models with $m(\charg) \gtrsim m(\lsp)+m(W)$ and where the sleptons and charged and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons are heavier than the charginos and neutralinos. The decay of the next-to-lightest neutralino through a Higgs boson, however, turns out not to be the most probable decay mode in many models where the competing decay $\neutr \rightarrow Z \lsp$ dominates instead.
The couplings of the next-to-lightest neutralino to the Higgs boson are suppressed by powers of $\vert\mu\vert/M_2$ in the gaugino-like regions~\cite{Arbey:2012fa}, meaning that the branching fraction of the $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$ decay takes on reasonably high values only in models with an \gls{lsp} containing a substantial bino component\footnote{The Higgs coupling suppression is illustrated in \cref{fig:higgs_coupling_neutralino}.}.

In the bulk of the $\charg$--$\lsp$ plane (cf.~\cref{fig:mchi1p_mlsp_contour}) that mostly contains models with a bino-like \gls{lsp}, many models cannot be excluded simply due to their relatively high $\charg$/$\neutr$ masses, and thus low $\charg\neutr$ pair production cross sections.
\Cref{fig:fig_scatter_xsec_BFHiggs_bino} shows a projection of the \gls{pmssm} models in a two-dimensional plane spanned by the $\charg\neutr$ pair production cross section and $\mathrm{BF}(\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp)$.
The colour of each model point indicates the expected CL$_s$ value\footnote{The expected CL$_s$ is preferred here over the observed one as it provides a better overview of the sensitivity of the \onelepton search.}, revealing that the \onelepton search only starts to become sensitive to models with $\sigma(\charg\neutr)$ larger than $\mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{\femto\barn})$.
This is in line with the sensitivity of the \onelepton analysis obtained in the simplified model scenario, where model points with electroweakino pair production cross sections as low as $\SI{4.1}{\femto\barn}$ were expected to be excluded.
\Cref{fig:fig_scatter_xsec_BFHiggs_bino} moreover shows that, for many models with $\sigma(\charg\neutr) \gtrsim\SI{1}{\femto\barn}$, the branching fraction of the next-to-lightest neutralino decay via a Higgs boson is vanishingly small. This ultimately results in a low number of events with Higgs boson candidates, causing a lack of sensitivity in the context of the \onelepton search.

Even with a sufficiently large electroweakino pair production cross section and at least moderate $\mathrm{BF}(\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp)$, a sizeable fraction of models turn out to have a relatively high \gls{lsp} mass of more than $\SI{300}{\GeV}$, as shown in \cref{fig:fig_scatter_mchi10_BFHiggs_bino_withXsecCut}. Coupled with an upper bound on the \mbox{$\charg$/$\neutr$} masses due to the pair production cross section requirement, these models thus tend to have comparably small electroweakino mass differences, resulting in signatures with reduced amounts of $\etmiss$ and softer objects that may not always be reconstructed in the \onelepton search and therefore contribute to a reduced sensitivity\footnote{See \cref{fig:norm_obs_app} for an illustration of this kinematic effect.}.

To illustrate the size of the sensitivity loss due to mixed branching fractions, a sizeable fraction of the models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} have been reprocessed with $\mathrm{BF}(\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp)$ fixed to unity, and $\mathrm{BF}(\neutr \rightarrow Z \lsp)$ consequently set to disappear. The modified models were subsequently reanalysed with the \onelepton search.
\Cref{fig:mchi1p_mchi20_contour_bino_lsp_wh_only} reveals that significantly more \gls{pmssm} models can be excluded within the simplified model contour when the branching fraction assumptions of the simplified model are restored. As the $\neutr$ decay into a $Z$ boson and $\lsp$ is the competing decay to $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$, statistically combining searches targeting these decay modes could therefore recover the loss in sensitivity originating from mixed branching fractions in realistic \gls{susy} models. Likewise, the development of searches targeting both decay modes at the same time, would also recover the full sensitivity\footnote{Provided that they are targeted with statistically independent signal regions such that a combined likelihood can be built.}.

\end{figure}

The impact of the \onelepton search on the \gls{pmssm} parameters relevant to the electroweak sector are shown in one-dimensional distributions in~\cref{fig:impact_pMSSM_parameters_1D}. As already discussed in~\cref{sec:impact_electroweakino_masses}, the \onelepton search has the largest impact for small values in the bino mass parameter $M_1$, leading to models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} when $M_1$ is significantly smaller than $M_2$ and $\mu$.
Consequently, the proportion of excluded models peaks at slightly higher values in the distribution of the wino mass parameter, \ie at around $\vert M_2\vert\approx\SI{400}{\GeV}$. As the search is not sensitive to compressed scenarios with a higgsino-like \gls{lsp}, no models with small values in $\vert\mu\vert$ can be excluded. 

Since the pseudoscalar Higgs boson does not directly enter the phenomenology of the models targeted by the \onelepton search, only indirect constraints can be set on $m_\mathrm{A}$, excluding models across the full range of the $m_\mathrm{A}$ distribution sampled.
A similar behaviour is observed in $\tan\beta$ where the excluded models have values of $\tan\beta$ spanning the full range from 1 to 60.
Likewise, no direct constraints on the trilinear scalar couplings ($A_t$, $A_b$, $A_\tau$), and the remaining gluino and third generation squark mass parameters ($M_3$, $m_{\tilde{Q}_3}$, $m_{\tilde{u}_3}$, $m_{\tilde{d}_3}$) is observed\footnote{Illustrated in \cref{fig:impact_pMSSM_parameters_1D_2}.}.

\subsection{Impact on dark matter relic density}

The cosmological abundance of the lightest neutralino $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}} h^2$ as a function of its type and mass is shown in~\cref{fig:relic_density_lsp}. The value of the \gls{dm} relic density measured by the Planck Collaboration is also given~\cite{Planck}. The Planck measurement is interpreted as an upper limit on the \gls{dm} relic density, thus allowing the $\lsp$ to be a sub-dominant \gls{dm} component.

\end{figure}


Some interesting features are worth highlighting in~\cref{fig:relic_density_lsp}. First, most of the models sampled with a bino-like $\lsp$ overproduce \gls{dm} and result in a cosmological abundance that is too high.
Of the \gls{pmssm} models sampled herein, only models with a $\lsp$ containing a considerable wino or higgsino component consistently satisfy $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}} h^2 < 0.12$ over a large range of the neutralino mass.
Models with $m(\lsp) \simeq m(Z)/2$ can produce especially low values in $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}} h^2$ as the neutralino can resonantly annihilate through \textit{s}-channel $Z$ exchange. This is the so-called \textit{Z-funnel}, a mechanism that becomes more efficient, the larger the higgsino component of the lightest neutralino is~\cite{Cabrera:2016wwr}.
Likewise, models with a nearly mass-degenerate $\charg\lsp$ pair with $ m(\charg$/$\neutr) \simeq m(W)/2$ can also produce low relic densities because of $\charg\lsp$ co-annihilation through \textit{s}-channel \textit{W} exchange.
A funnel similar to the $Z$-funnel, but involving \textit{s}-channel Higgs exchange, exists at $m(\lsp) \simeq m(h)/2$. It requires the $\lsp$ to have a sizeable bino component~\cite{Cabrera:2016wwr} and is not visible in~\cref{fig:relic_density_lsp} because models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} are underrepresented in the relevant mass range.

In practice, the \gls{lep} limits\footnote{The limit on the chargino mass of $m(\charg) > \SI{92}{\GeV}$ considered herein is a conservative lower limit. In a large region of the phase space, the limits on the chargino mass set by \gls{lep} reach as high as $\SI{103.5}{\GeV}$. The impact of the chargino mass limit in the $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}} h^2$--$m(\lsp)$ projection is shown in \cref{fig:relic_density_lsp_withConstraint}.} on the chargino mass of $m(\charg) > \SI{92}{\GeV}$~\cite{lep_susy_results} rule out models with $\vert M_2 \vert \lesssim \SI{100}{\GeV}$ and $\vert \mu \vert \lesssim \SI{100}{\GeV}$, leaving only models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} in the region with $m(\lsp)\lesssim \SI{100}{\GeV}$.
Although models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} could theoretically produce low $\lsp$ relic density values through the $Z$- and $h$-funnels, in practice, such models are not sampled herein due to the sampling technique employed.
To further study the impact of the \onelepton search on models relevant to the \gls{dm} phenomenology, \ie models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} in the $Z$- and $h$-funnels, a different sampling technique would need to be employed, including experimental constraints in the sampling priors in addition to specifically oversampling models with a bino-like \gls{lsp} in the relevant mass range.
%For this reason, in this work, only a very small number of models with a bino-like $\lsp$ with $m(\lsp) \lesssim \SI{100}{\GeV}$ have a relic density compatible with the Planck measurement.
%Oversampling this region should however still reveal the typical $Z$- and $h$-funnels for models with a bino-like \gls{lsp}~\cite{pMSSM-scan-run1:2015baa,Aaboud:2016wna}.
%If the $\charg/\neutr$ masses of such models fall into the range where the \onelepton search is sensitive,\ie $\charg\neutr$ pair production has high enough cross section, the \onelepton search can be excepted to exclude a sizeable fraction of these models, thus warranting additional, dedicated scans using experimental constraints in the sampling priors. 

Although of limited use due to the limited number of models in the relevant parameter space, the impact of the \onelepton search on the \gls{dm} relic density can still be investigated with the models available. \Cref{fig:relic_density_lsp_cls} shows the $\lsp$ cosmological abundance in dependence of the $\lsp$ mass. Instead of encoding the nature of the $\lsp$, the colour now encodes the observed CL$_s$ value obtained by the \onelepton search. By comparing with \cref{fig:relic_density_lsp}, it can be seen that the majority of bino-like models excluded by the \onelepton search overproduce \gls{dm}. Through its limited sensitivity to some of the models with a wino-like $\lsp$, the \onelepton search is, however, still able to exclude some models with a compatible relic density. 

\section{Discussion}

Large-scale reinterpretations in high-dimensional \gls{susy} model spaces are crucial in order to assess the sensitivity of \gls{susy} searches in the context of realistic \gls{susy} scenarios. The evaluation of signal models at smeared truth-level, in combination with the simplified likelihoods introduced in~\cref{ch:simplify}, offers a computationally efficient and reliable approach for such reinterpretations.

A reinterpretation of the \onelepton search in a limited number of models sampled from the \gls{pmssm} with a focus on the electroweak sector has been discussed. It revealed that the \onelepton search is sensitive to \gls{susy} scenarios beyond the canonical simplified model originally considered.
Although with some caveats, the simplified model phenomenology generally maps reasonably well onto a portion of the \gls{pmssm} parameter space. The \onelepton search is, as expected, found to be most sensitive to \gls{pmssm} models with wino-like $\charg\neutr$ pair production and a bino-like \gls{lsp}. Interestingly, some sensitivity was found towards $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2\neutr$ pair production in models with a wino-like \gls{lsp}.

In general, the sensitivity of the \onelepton search towards \gls{pmssm} models is observed to be negatively impacted by the competing decays $\neutr \rightarrow Z \lsp$ and $\neutr \rightarrow h \lsp$, breaking one of the main assumptions of the simplified model.
In order to maximise the sensitivity of future searches to $\charg\neutr$ pair production in more complete \gls{susy} scenarios, it is therefore crucial to target both decay modes at the same time.
In searches targeting final states with a lepton, multiple jets and missing transverse momentum, both the \textit{b}-jet multiplicity as well as the invariant mass of the jets originating from the decays $h\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $Z\rightarrow q\bar{q}$ can easily be exploited to develop disjoint\footnote{Building signal regions that are not orthogonal to each other prevents the construction of a combined likelihood and thus does not allow full statistical combination.} signal regions targeting both decay modes.

Beyond the combination of single decay modes, it could be worth targeting not only $\charg\neutr$ pair production, but also $\charg\charg$ pair production at the same time in a single likelihood function. In the ATLAS Collaboration, work is for example ongoing to perform a search for electroweakinos in the \onelepton final state using dedicated signal regions simultaneously targeting both $\charg\neutr \rightarrow WZ\lsp\lsp$ and $\charg\charg \rightarrow WW\lsp\lsp$. 

Finally, the impact of the \onelepton search on the \gls{dm} relic density was discussed. The parameter ranges and sampling technique chosen were used to allow the scan to be as general as possible. For this reason, a large fraction of the models sampled are not directly relevant to the \gls{dm} phenomenology. Only a small number of models with a bino-like $\lsp$ are sampled from the $Z$- and $h$-funnel region where $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}} h^2 < 0.12$ can be expected to be satisfied for a sizeable fraction of such models. Outside of these two funnels, models with a bino-like $\lsp$ satisfying the relic density constraint tend to have a $\lsp$ mass outside of the range that the \onelepton search is sensitive to. 

In order to be able to further investigate the impact of the \onelepton search on \gls{dm} observables, a different sampling technique would need to be adopted, including experimental constraints in the sampling priors and oversampling the relevant regions of the parameter space.
The initial sampling of the models, the calculation of their mass spectra and other observables, and the application of experimental constraints is computationally relatively cheap. Therefore, oversampling the relevant parameter space with a brute-force method can be a feasible approach.
Machine learning approaches, as for example clustering techniques, can additionally be used to group models into different phenomenological \textit{clusters}, possibly allowing to determine refined parameter ranges to be manually oversampled.
Alternatively, active \textit{smart sampling} approaches (as opposed to manually determining and oversampling certain parameter ranges) relying on machine learning methods can be leveraged and are being studied with the aim of improving the sampling efficiency. For example, to dynamically oversample regions of the parameter space with rapidly changing phenomenology and, conversely, undersample regions with low experimental sensitivity or only slowly changing phenomenology\footnote{The formalisation of this problem is in many aspects directly related to the problem of finding an \textit{inverse map} from the space of \gls{lhc} signatures to the parameter space of \gls{bsm} models, discussed in \reference~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2005px}.}, information geometry methods~\cite{amari1985differential-geometrical} relying on the Fisher information matrix to quantise the change in phenomenology can be exploited~\cite{information_geometry}.
