This chapter discusses the results of the different fit configurations and hypothesis tests performed in the analysis. After the background estimation obtained through a background-only fit in the \glspl{cr} is validated in the \glspl{vr}, the \glspl{sr} are unblinded and the observed data is compared to the \gls{sm} background expectation.

As all \glspl{cr} are mutually exclusive, a background-only fit simultaneously using information from all \glspl{cr} can be run. Only the terms for the \glspl{cr} enter the likelihood as channels and any signal contamination present in the \glspl{cr} is neglected. This allows to fit the dominant backgrounds to data, and thus by construction leads to a good agreement between observed data and the total fitted background estimate in all \glspl{cr}. The free normalisation parameters for $\ttbar$ ($\mu_\mathrm{T}$), single top ($\mu_\mathrm{ST}$) and $\wjets$ ($\mu_\mathrm{W}$) are fitted to be
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\mu_\mathrm{T} = 1.02^{+0.07}_{-0.09}, \\
		\mu_\mathrm{ST} = 0.6^{+0.5}_{-0.25}, \\
		\mu_\mathrm{W} = 1.22^{+0.26}_{-0.24}. \\
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
While the dominant $\ttbar$ background stays roughly at its nominal expectation with respect to \gls{mc} simulation, $\wjets$ processes are scaled up. The single top expectation, on the other hand, is scaled down. The high uncertainty on $\mu_\mathrm{ST}$ can be attributed to the relatively low \gls{mc} statistics as well as the comparably low purity of single top events in STR.

\Cref{tab:results_bkg_only_CR} summarises the fitted background estimate including all uncertainties for all control regions. As discussed in~\cref{ch:background_estimation}, $\ttbar$ is the most dominant in all control regions except WR where $\wjets$ is the largest background, followed by single top and $\wjets$ processes. Small contributions come from diboson, multiboson as well as other backgrounds like $\ttbar+V$, $\ttbar+h$ and $V+h$. All processes estimated directly from \gls{mc} simulation cumulatively account for only 10\%, 5.5\% and a maximum of 2.6\% in the single top, $\wjets$ and $\ttbar$ control regions, respectively. Exemplary distributions in the \glspl{cr} after the background-only fit are shown in~\cref{fig:CR_distributions_postfit}, revealing a good agreement between observed data and the \gls{sm} background estimate throughout the distributions shown.

In order to validate the extrapolations from the \glspl{cr} to the \glspl{sr}, the results of the background-only fit in are extrapolated into the \glspl{vr}. \Cref{tab:results_bkg_only_VR} details the observed data and background estimation before and after the fit in the different \gls{vr} bins. 

In the on-peak \glspl{vr}, $\ttbar$ is by far the dominant background. Contributions from single top and $\wjets$ each amount to only 1--5\%, depending on validation region bin. Diboson, multiboson and other \gls{sm} processes result in minor contributions of the level of not more than 3\% of the total background estimate. As the total uncertainties on the background estimate in the on-peak regions are dominated by the $\ttbar$ uncertainties, the large uncertainties on the $\wjets$ and single top estimate due to relatively limited \gls{mc} statistics do not have a significant impact. 
In the off-peak \glspl{vr}, $\ttbar$ is the dominant process in the low mass regime, while contribution from single top and $\wjets$ are subdominant. In the medium and high mass regimes, $\ttbar$, single top and $\wjets$ all result in similar contributions. Diboson, multiboson and other \gls{sm} processes are only minor backgrounds in all off-peak regions, cumulatively amounting to only 10--14\% of the total background estimate depending on the mass regime.
Exemplary N-1 distributions in the validation regions after the results from the background-only fit are extrapolated are shown in~\cref{fig:VR_distributions_postfit}.

The agreement between data and the background estimate is summarised in~\cref{result_histpull}. \improvement{quote exact numbers} The background estimates agree within $1.5\sigma$ with the observed data in all validation regions, except for the VR-onMM where the agreement is within $1.9\sigma$. Thus, the overall agreement in the validation regions is considered to be acceptable, paving the way for further extrapolation of the background estimate into the \glspl{sr}.

\subsection{Results in the signal regions}

By extrapolating the results from the background-only fit in the control regions, the background estimate in the signal regions can be obtained. \Cref{tab:results_bkg_only_SR_disc} compares the background estimate with the observed data for all discovery signal regions. In the low mass discovery signal region, $\ttbar$ is the dominant background, followed by $\wjets$ and single top. In the medium mass discovery signal region, all three main backgrounds contribute at roughly equal parts. In the high mass signal region, $\wjets$ is the largest \gls{sm} background, followed by single top and $\ttbar$. In all discovery signal regions, diboson, multiboson and other \gls{sm} backgrounds yield only minor contributions. The results in the exclusion signal regions are shown in \cref{tab:results_bkg_only_SR}. As for the discovery signal regions, $\ttbar$ is the dominant background in the low mass signal region bins, while $\wjets$ slightly dominates in the high mass signal region bins. The $\mct$ distribution in all three exclusion \glspl{sr} are shown in~\cref{SR_distributions_postfit}.

None of the exclusion or discovery signal regions reveal a significant deviation from the \gls{sm} background estimate in data, meaning that all observations are compatible with the \gls{sm}. Consequently, the signal regions will be used in the following to derive model-dependent as well as model-independent limits. A slight overfluctuation of data in the discovery \glspl{sr} (that are not mutually exclusive) is quantified to be within $2\sigma$, resulting in weaker model-independent limits than expected. Some of the exclusion signal region bins also exhibit slight overfluctuations in data, all well within $2\sigma$ of the \gls{sm} background estimate. Thus, the observed model-dependent exclusion limit derived in~\cref{sec:results_interpretation} is slightly weaker than expected. \Cref{fig:result_histpull} summarises for all regions the observed data, \gls{sm} background estimate as well as the significances of any deviations.

\section{Interpretation}\label{sec:results_interpretation}

As no significant excess of data is observed in any of the signal regions, model-independent as well as model-dependent limits are are computed.

\subsection{Model-independent upper limits} 

Model-independent upper limits on the visible cross section of new physics are derived using the discovery \glspl{sr}. For this, a likelihood containing terms for the \glspl{cr} and the discovery \glspl{sr} is used. Since the discovery \glspl{sr} are not mutually exclusive, only one discovery \gls{sr} enters the likelihood at a time. This results in three distinct fit configurations in which the signal strength $\mu$ is the \gls{poi} and no signal contamination is assumed in the control regions. The \gls{poi} is subsequently scanned in distinct steps from 0 to high\footnote{The signal strength is in principle allowed to exceed unity in order to find an 95\% CL upper limit} values, followed by a hypothesis test at each scan step. The upper limit on the number of observed signal events $S_{\mathrm{ obs}}^{95}$ is then given by the value of $\mu$ for which the corresponding CL$_s$ value drops below 0.05. An upper limit on the visible cross section $\langle\epsilon{\mathrm{ \sigma}}\rangle_{\mathrm{ obs}}^{95}$ is then obtained by dividing $S_{\mathrm{ obs}}^{95}$ by the integrated luminosity of \onethirtynineifb. In addition to the upper limits on $\langle\epsilon{\mathrm{ \sigma}}\rangle_{\mathrm{ obs}}^{95}$ and $S_{\mathrm{ obs}}^{95}$,~\cref{tab:upperlimit_toys} also gives the $p$-values (and corresponding significances) for rejecting the background-only hypothesis in favour of the signal-plus-background hypothesis. As all significances are below $1.88\sigma$ for all \glspl{sr}, no indication for physics beyond the \gls{sm} is seen.

\subsection{Model-dependent exclusion limits}

For each signal point in the signal grid considered, a separate \textit{exclusion} fit is run in the \glspl{cr} and the exclusion \glspl{sr}. As all exclusion signal region bins are disjoint, a likelihood containing terms for all bins can be constructed, effectively creating a shape-fit in the binned variables $\mt$ and $\mct$. As opposed to the background-only fit, the exclusion fits allow for signal contribution in all regions considered, and considers the signal strength $\mu$ to be a free parameter. For each point in the signal grid, the expected and observed CL$_s$ value is calculated as discussed in~\cref{sec:cls_approach}. Expected (observed) contour lines can then be drawn at expected (observed) CL$_s =0.05$. Signal points inside the contour are excluded at 95\% CL. \Cref{fig:result_exclusion} shows the exclusion contours obtained in the $\charg\neutr$ signal grid considered in the analysis. The dashed line corresponds to the expected exclusion contour, obtained using the Asimov dataset. The yellow uncertainty band represents the interval containing 68\% of all exclusion contours obtained for observations distributed according to the background-only hypothesis. The solid red line represents the observed exclusion limit obtained using the data recorded by ATLAS. As discussed in~\cref{sec:signal_theory_uncertainties}, the dashed red lines are obtained by varying the signal cross sections up and down by $1\sigma$.

Due to the slight overfluctuations of data observed in some of the exclusion signal region bins, the observed limit is slightly weaker than the expected one. The observed exclusion limit extends to about $\SI{740}{\GeV}$ in $m(\charg/\neutr)$ for massless $\lsp$, and up to $\SI{600}{\GeV}$ for $m(\lsp)=\SI{250}{\GeV}$. This extends the previous limit set by ATLAS in this simplified model and decay channel by more than $\SI{200}{\GeV}$ in $m(\charg/\neutr)$ for massless $\lsp$, an improvement made possible not only by the increase in integrated luminosity but also the introduction of a two-dimensional shape fit in the analysis strategy.

\section{Discussion}

At the time of writing, the limits derived in this analysis are the most stringent limits on the $\charg\neutr\rightarrow Wh\lsp\lsp$ simplified model set by an ATLAS search~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2020-020}, surpassing not only the previous iteration of the analysis~\cite{asds}, but also yielding more stringent limits than those published by ATLAS in other decay channels of the same model. \Cref{fig:result_wh_summary} shows a summary of results published by ATLAS searches in the $\charg\neutr\rightarrow Wh\lsp\lsp$ simplified model. The search presented in this work is referred to as \textit{1Lbb}. Additional searches in the 0 lepton as well as 1 lepton final states are being worked on, and are expected to extend the limits on $m(\charg/\neutr)$ up to roughly $\SI{1}{\TeV}$ for massless $\lsp$ as well as slightly extend the excluded parameter space towards the diagonal where $m(\charg/\neutr) = m(\lsp) + m(h)$\footnote{Assuming that no significant excess in data is seen in the search regions of these analyses.}.\improvement{cite}

Various other searches for \gls{susy} at both ATLAS and CMS are constraining a multitude of other supersymmetric particle production and decay processes. The limits on gluino and squark pair production at the \gls{lhc} are particularly heavily constrained, reaching $\SI{2}{\TeV}$ in many cases. With the large integrated luminosity available through the full Run~2 dataset and the improved analysis techniques and strategies developed over the last years, the typically weaker limits on electroweakinos and sleptons are also significantly increasing and in some cases approach the $\SI{1}{\TeV}$ mark. The vast \gls{susy} search program at ATLAS and CMS thus heavily constrains the existence of \gls{susy} at the $\SI{}{\TeV}$ scale. 
Still, discarding the possibility for \gls{susy} to exist at the energies available with the \gls{lhc} is much too early, for several reasons. By the end of the lifetime of the \gls{lhc} (including the high luminosity upgrade HL-LHC), a projected amount of $\SI{3000}{\per\femto\barn}$~\cite{Apollinari:2116337} will have been delivered to the particle physics experiments. 
Many supersymmetric models not accessible with the full Run~2 dataset using today's analyses will hence only be in reach in the coming years of the \gls{lhc}.
%Finally, even if not directly accessible at LHC energies, \gls{susy} could reveal itself through quantum correction effects in precision measurements.

More importantly, most of the quoted limits assume simplified \gls{susy} models and are thus only valid if the assumptions of the respective simplified model are realised in nature. 
In any realistic \gls{susy} scenario that could be realised in nature and is accessible to the \gls{lhc}, assumptions like 100\% branching ratios or a small set of supersymmetric particles participating in the decay chains are most likely not exactly fulfilled. 
Thus, the quoted simplified model limits can in general not be trivially interpreted as the true underlying constraint on the respective parameter of a more realistic \gls{susy} scenario. 
Due to the optimistic assumptions like 100\% branching fractions, the true constraints will in general be significantly weaker than the simplified model limits.
Reinterpretations of Run~1 ATLAS \gls{susy} searches in the \gls{pmssm}~\cite{pMSSM-scan-run1:2015baa} have indeed shown that constraints on the supersymmetric masses are weaker in more complex \gls{susy} models than those quoted for the simplified models studied in most analyses.

Naturally, there is a large interest in the high-energy physics community---both within ATLAS as well as outside of the collaboration---to perform reinterpretations of the existing \gls{susy} searches in new, promising signal models. Compelling reasons for performing reinterpretations include, amongst others, the possibility to state a combined sensitivity of the ATLAS search program to more realistic and complex \gls{susy} scenarios (compared to the simplified model limits). However, especially when considering high-dimensional parameter spaces like the \gls{pmssm}, such reinterpretation efficiencies quickly become extremely computationally expensive and require appropriate approximations. The following part of this work will introduce and discuss some of these approximations and show preliminary reinterpretation results of the analysis in the \gls{pmssm}.
