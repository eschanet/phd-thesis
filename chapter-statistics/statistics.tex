Statistical models are used in order to order to quantify the correspondence between theoretical predictions and the experimental observations in searches for \gls{bsm} physics. This chapter introduces the statistical concepts, methods and formulae used in this work for statistical inference. A frequentist approach to statistics is employed, interpreting probabilities as the frequencies of the outcomes of repeatable experiments that may either be real, based on computer simulations, or mathematical abstraction~\cite{pdg2020,Cranmer:2015nia}. The ensuing description largely follows~\cite{Cranmer:2015nia, Cowan:2010js}

\section{The likelihood function}
 
In measurements in high energy physics, a \textit{statistical model} $f(\boldsymbol{x}\vert\boldsymbol{\phi})$ is a parametric family of \glspl{pdf} describing the probability of observing data $\boldsymbol{x}$ given a set of model parameters $\phi$ that typically describe parameters of the physical theory or unknown detector effects. The \textit{likelihood function} $L(\boldsymbol{\phi})$ is then numerically equivalent to $f(\boldsymbol{x}\vert\boldsymbol{\phi})$ with $\boldsymbol{x}$ fixed. As opposed to the \gls{pdf} $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ which describes the value of $f$ as a function of $\boldsymbol{x}$ given a fixed set of parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$, the likelihood refers to the value of $f$ as a function of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ given a fixed value of $\boldsymbol{x}$.

Searches for \gls{bsm} physics are typically centred around the measurement of several disjoint binned distributions (called \textit{channels} $c$) that are each associated with different event selection criteria (as opposed to different scattering processes) yielding observed event counts $\boldsymbol{n}$. In such counting experiments where each event is independently drawn from the same underlying distribution, each bin is fundamentally described by a Poisson term. The Poisson probability to observe $n$ events with a expectation of $\nu$ events, is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Pois}(n\vert\nu) = \frac{\nu^n}{n!}e^{-\nu}.
\end{equation}
The expectation $\nu_{cb}$ in each channel $c$ and bin $b$ is a sum over the set of physics processes considered (called \textit{samples}). The sample-wise rates are in general a function of the the model parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$, that can either be \textit{free parameters} $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ or \textit{constrained parameters} $\boldsymbol{\chi}$. Free parameters directly determined by the Poisson terms for the data observations are called \textit{normalisation factors} $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. The constrained parameters represent the systematic uncertainties $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. The degree to which they cause a deviation of the expected event rates from the nominal event rates is limited through \textit{constraint terms} $c_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(a_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}\vert\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ that can be viewed as \textit{auxiliary measurements} with global observed data $\boldsymbol{a}$. 

For a given observation $\boldsymbol{x} = (\boldsymbol{n},\boldsymbol{a})$ of observed events $\boldsymbol{n}$ and auxiliary data $\boldsymbol{a}$, the likelihood then reads
\begin{equation}
	L (\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}, \boldsymbol{\mu_\mathrm{sample}}, \boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \prod_{c\in\mathrm{channels}} \prod_{b\in\mathrm{bins_c}} \mathrm{Pois}(n_{cb}\vert\nu_{cb}(\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}, \boldsymbol{\mu_\mathrm{sample}}, \boldsymbol{\alpha})) \prod_{\alpha\in\boldsymbol{\alpha}}c_\alpha (a_\alpha\vert\alpha),
\end{equation}
where, given a certain integrated luminosity, $n_{cb}$ and $\nu_{cb}$ refer to the corresponding observed and expected rate of events, respectively~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-029}. The constraint terms $c_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(a_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}\vert\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ are modelled by a Gaussian with mean $a = 0\vert\alpha$ and variance $\sigma = 1$. The parameters $\alpha$ are given as \textit{up} and \textit{down} variations representing $\pm1\sigma$ variations. In order to derive their impact on each bin for any given value 


%\begin{equation}
%	\nu_{cb}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = \sum_{s\in\mathrm{samples}}{}\nu_{scb}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = \sum_{s\in\mathrm{samples}}{\left(\prod_{\kappa\in\boldsymbol{\kappa}}\kappa_{scb}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\right)\left(\nu^0_{scb}(\boldsymbol{\phi})+\sum_{\Delta\in\boldsymbol{\Delta}}\Delta_{scb}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\right)},
%\end{equation} 
%where $\nu_{scb}$ are sample-wise event rates determined from \textit{nominal rates} $\nu^0_{scb}$ and a set of multiplicative and additive \textit{rate modifiers} $\boldsymbol{\kappa(\phi)}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Delta(\phi)}$, that are functions of the model parameters (typically only a single parameter per modifier). The modifiers are paired with a constraint term in order to implement systematic uncertainties into the statistical model. The event rates in a given bin can be affected by multiple parameters and single parameters can 



 The full model parameter set is typically separated into \textit{parameters of interest} $\boldsymbol{\psi}$ and \textit{nuisance parameters} $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ that are not of immediate interest but need to be accounted for in the statistical model. In the search presented in this work, the only \gls{poi} is the \textit{signal strength} parameter $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$, representing the ratio of the signal process cross section to its reference cross section as expected from theory.


The expectation $\nu_i$ in each bin $i$ can be parametrised through the introduction of a signal strength parameter $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$ by
\begin{equation}
	\nu_i = \mu_{\mathrm{sig}}s_i + b_i,
\end{equation}
where $s_i$ and $b_i$ are the bin-wise expected signal and background rates, respectively. The signal strength $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$ and is used as \gls{poi} in fits to data. Fixing $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}} = 0$ yields a \gls{sm} expectation, while $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}} = 1$ represents a \textit{signal-plus-background} description at nominal signal cross section. Scanning multiple values of $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$ allows to set limits on the visible cross sections of the signal models considered in the search. 
  
For each of the channels, the total event rate is the sum over a set of physics processes, called \textit{samples}. The sample-wise event rates are in general a function of the the model parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$
